## Welcome to TerriblyUnclever's Blog!

I am a 17 year old senior in high school. I will go to Wichita State University in Fall 2018 and will major in Mathematics. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what I'll blog about, but I'll think of something, surely.

For now, I won't be deleting anymore of the code, as I'll need some of the information in it for future reference.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TerriblyUnclever/TerriblyUnclever.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
